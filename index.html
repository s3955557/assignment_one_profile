        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
          <p>I’m a current Bachelor of IT student at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. Throughout my career, I have obtained experience in Finance & Investments, Corporate Sales, and I have worked in a number of technology startups in various capacities.</p>
          <p>My previous studies include a Bachelor of Business (Management Major), a Diploma of Stockbroking, and Level 1 of the Chartered Financial Analyst Program. I have also completed the Google IT Support Professional Certificate and the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.</p>
          <p>I’m fluent in both English and Turkish, and was born and raised in Sydney where I currently reside. I have had the pleasure of working in London, and have travelled to dozens of locations across North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions. I have a keen interest in fitness, enjoy training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and have recently completed a marathon.</p>

        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
          <p>My passion for IT began at the ripe age of about 6 years old when I first discovered computer games and was forced to learn my way around MS-DOS and the command line so that I could install and play my favourite games on my home PC. Much of my time since then has been spent playing with computers through the early periods of the internet entering homes, invention of online chat and social media, the evolution of gaming consoles, and the introduction of smartphones.</p>
          <p>Even though I have spent a lot of my spare time teaching myself various aspects of IT, it was during the global COVID-19 pandemic when I took this a step further and completed the Google IT Support Professional Certificate and the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate via Coursera.</p>
          <p>My enjoyment and success in these courses led me to the Bachelor of IT at RMIT University via Open Universities Australia. My reason for selecting this course was that it provided superior flexibility and control compared to other programs so that I could pursue my goals and manage my studies around work and a very busy lifestyle. My research into different universities showed that RMIT University was well placed in global and national rankings according to QS World University Rankings 2022.</p>
          <p>My primary aim is to build excellent software development skills and combine this with my expertise in business, in order to develop technological solutions for the business problems of tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
          <h3>The Role</h3>
          <p>My ideal job is that of Full Stack Developer</p>
          <p>The current open role is with HelloFresh</p>
          <p>As a Full Stack Developer, you are often responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of all aspects of a software application.
            ‘Full Stack’ is often broken down into Front End and Back End, and so Full Stack Development encompasses both of these areas.
            The ‘Front End’ commonly refers to the user interface, the look and feel of a web page or web application. This is everything the user interprets with their senses and often includes visual design elements.
            The ‘Back End’ on the other hand is what happens behind the scenes. It often includes the logic and algorithms of an application and determines how and where data is stored, manipulated, sourced for presentation back to the user. The technologies surrounding databases and application deployment fall within Back End development.(Trista Liu, hackernoon.com)(geeksforgeeks, n.d.)</p>
          <p>The Full Stack Developer role with HelloFresh specifically deals with developing and maintaining applications to be used internally to solve business problems experienced by the marketing team. As mentioned in the ad, it involves the full software development lifecycle, including meeting with stakeholders, gathering requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, documentation and user training. The specific technologies and frameworks used at HelloFresh are centred around Python/Flask. The role is appealing to me as I am currently learning programming in Python (Introduction to Programming); it encompasses a broad range of responsibilities and so the role will provide variety and interesting tasks; and most importantly the role is responsible for understanding and solving business problems and stakeholder engagement, which ties in very nicely with my previous career experience and qualifications. The aspect of managing a Graduate developer is exciting as I greatly enjoy being engaged in coaching and teaching others.</p>

            </ul>

          <h2> Personality Profile</h2>

            <p>
              Self-awareness will also be a key component of the journey from where I am currently into my ideal job.
            </p>
            <p>In this section I share the findings from three different tests:
              <ol>
                <li>The Myers Briggs Type Indicator;</li>
                <li>The Big Five Personality Test;</li>
                <li>The Learning Style Assessment.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>The results of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator Personality test as found in the 16 Personalities website (www.16personalities.com), show that I am ENTP Type, also known as ‘The Debater’.
            As for the Big Five Personality Test, I score very high in Openness and Extraversion and score low for Neuroticism. Whereas the Learning Style Assessment shows that I am a dominant Visual Learner.
            When interpreting the implications of these results, firstly I didn’t find many surprises as the various results showed findings that I expected to see. I have a high level of self-awareness of how I interact with people, information, and the world around me in general.</p>
            <p>If we take personality tests to be somewhat accurate, they have the potential to be very beneficial. They can tell us a lot about ourselves, and foster a better understanding of both ourselves and the people around us.
            Therefore our personalities can greatly impact the way in which we interact with others in the classroom, at work, and when working in teams. I am highly visual, extraverted, and expressive, but also driven by rational thought, intuitive decision making, and lean heavily to optimism. These traits naturally influence me to get along with team members who are also like myself and have similar characteristics. What I need to be mindful of though, is to be sensitive and considerate of more introverted people, people who like to take feelings and intricate details into account when decision-making. I also need to be on the lookout for a potential clash with low-openness team members who prefer a more tightly structured, traditional approach to a task.
            When forming a team, I believe it is important to have a balance of personality types and take advantage of varied talents and skillset in order to achieve the synergy of a well-rounded team. It is important to foster a team spirit of respect, collaboration, and striving towards a common goal.
            </p>

        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <h3>The Concept</h3>
          <p>The project idea that I would like to develop is that of a crowdfunding platform to invest in esports ventures such as esports teams and athletes. I would like to innovate a way for esports teams and athletes to be able to monetise their future potential earnings from endorsement and sponsorship deals as well as earnings from esports competitions. The benefit that the platform would bring to esport teams and athletes is to gain access to funds earlier in their careers for the purpose of investing in themselves, covering costs such as gaming equipment and travel to events, as even for personal projects such as obtaining better schooling and housing.
          The benefit this would bring to investors looking to invest in esports teams and athletes is the opportunity to participate in a percentage of future earnings attained by the esport teams and athletes which can be highly lucrative, as well as to be part of an exciting fast-growing niche industry in the early phase of its life cycle.

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            Why is this project important? Video gaming is no longer just a hobby or pastime. It is quite common now for professional gamers to compete around the world in tournaments for substantial prize money in broadcast events. Much like professional sports teams, esport organisations have been established, backed by investors, with the purpose of recruiting the best gamers from around to represent them in tournaments. The esports industry is made up of revenue from physical and digital games sales, in-game purchases, subscription services, sponsorship deals, ticket sales, media rights, and merchandise sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Statista.com:
            <ul>
              <li>The global esports market size is expected to grow from 1.28 billion US dollars to 2.89 billion US dollars. Representing a compound annual growth rate of 23 per cent</li>
              <li>Professional esports team ‘Team Spirit’ earned almost 19 million US dollars in 2021</li>
              <li>The highest-earning player in 2021 was Ukraine’s Miroslaw Kolpakov (Mira), who earned approximately 3.7 million US dollars</li>
              <li>Founded in 2000, esports team ‘Team Liquid has earned almost 38 million US dollars in prize money</li>
              <li>In 2021 Free Fire World Series hosted in Singapore became the most-watched esports event of all time with 5.41 million peak viewers</li>
              <li>In 2021 esports tournament ‘The International’ has a total prize pool of over 40 million US dollars</li>
              <li>The worldwide esports audience in 2021 was 474 million. Of this number 234 million fell in the category of esport enthusiasts</li>
              <li>One of the leading esports organisations ‘Cloud9’ was reportedly worth 350 million US dollars in 2020</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Developing this project is in line with my passion for gaming and investments. The project also has a massive potential to deliver a positive social impact, and improve the lives of young gamers around the world.</p>

        <h3>Desciption of Product</h3>
          <p>In order to achieve the vision for the project, it is important that deliberate thought and care be put into the research, design, development and launch of the esports crowdfunding platform.

          The platform will be a place where esports athletes can create a name for themself and showcase their achievements to potential investors. Athletes will sign up, be required to authenticate their email address, whilst agreeing to terms. They will then be directed to complete their profile much like any other social media platform.</p>

          <p>Esports athlete profiles will include:
            <ul>
              <li>Full name</li>
              <li>City and country of residence</li>
              <li>Gamer name</li>
              <li>Links to social and streaming profiles such as Twitch</li>
              <li>Any teams they might belong to</li>
              <li>Which games they play</li>
              <li>How many hours they play on average per week</li>
              <li>How many hours they have clocked on their favourite games</li>
              <li>List of achievements such as how they have ranked in competitions</li>
              <li>Previous prize money if any</li>
              <li>Existing sponsorships and endorsement deals in any</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Esports athletes will need to set a limit to the maximum percentage of sales they would like to make available on the platform for investors to purchase.
          The investment structure can take many forms. An example would be an esports athlete will make a total of 50 per cent of their total earnings available for purchase, as they might decide to keep the other 50 per cent to themselves. This can be purchased by one investor who would like to own 50 per cent of the earnings, or two investors own 25 per cent each, or five investors who own 10 per cent of the earnings each and so on.
          The esports athletes will need to be given general guidance on how to price their future earnings, but the choice will ultimately be theirs to make. This might include an algorithm that collates all the available data of the price of other esport athletes' earnings, and generates a range based on multiple variables on the data available. The data may be analysed on the basis of other comparable athletes, and ratios may be generated such as price per percentage of earnings, price per dollar of earnings, earnings average growth rate, and so on.</p>
          <p>On the other side of the transaction will be investors. So the platform will have clear links to separate sections of the web app for investors and athletes. Investors will be given search functionality based on the profile questions that the athletes must input, as well as the variable investment parameters and investment ratios. This will help them pinpoint the search results to show the type of esport athletes they are seeking, and the type of investments they would like to engage in. An example of this is an investor might look to invest in esport athletes from a certain region of the world; they might seek a lower or higher level of risk; they might look for higher levels of growth, or esport athletes that present better ‘value for money’.
          he potential drawback is that there will be no simple solution to ensure that the information added to profiles is accurate. Investments are risky, and there are likely to be regulatory hurdles to cross depending on if the platform is deemed a financial product or service by regulatory bodies such as ASIC.</p>

        <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>The most likely format for the esports crowdfunding platform will be a web app. There is also potential later down the track for mobile apps to be developed for both iOS and Android platforms. As the product feature-set does not necessarily require functionality unique to smartphones, mobile apps may be dropped from the business model altogether allowing the engineering team to focus solely on the web app.
            The framework to be used for the web app will be made up of the MERN stack centred around Javascript. This is a popular development stack used by development teams at the moment with the MERN stack very prevalent amongst startups. The use of a common and popular set of development technologies will also make it easier down the track to hire and build an engineering team and developer talent in a cost-effective way.</p>

        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
            <p>The skills required will be the design of the web app using principles of human-centred design and human-computer interaction. The tools likely to be used for the wireframing, mockup, and prototyping will be Figma and Sketch. The ability to create clean, effective user interfaces using these software programs will be necessary. Hardware requirements will be fairly straightforward as most if not all of the design and early development work can be completed on any modern laptop.</p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The vision for the project is that a crowdfunding platform project will be created where one does not exist already. The impact of this crowdfunding platform will grow in line with the growth of the esports industry, which is quite substantial according to the aforementioned research statistics. Another major factor will be the market share and reach of the platform, as esports is truly a global phenomenon. This is where the efforts of a talented growth and digital marketing team will be critical. The right investments have the potential to create substantial profits for those involves, but most importantly the project aims to deliver increases in the quality of life for the millions of emerging esports athletes around the world who could use the funds received to boost their gaming success, improve the standard of schooling, and deliver a better future for those they care most about.</p>
